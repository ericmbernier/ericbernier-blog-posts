---

This is the source-code for my [Building a RESTful API with Flask, Flask-RESTful, SQLAlchemy and pytest](https://ericbernier.com/flask-restful-api) blog post. This post assumes you have [Python 3 installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/), as well as [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-pipenv). Please read the post for further details.

To start the Flask-RESTFul API simply execute the following from the command line once everything is installed:
```bash
$ python football_api/api.py 
```
